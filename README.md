# Smart-Street-lights-with-air-quality-monitoring-system.
This project integrates smart street lighting with an air pollution monitoring system. The air pollution monitoring system was designed to monitor and analyse air quality in real-time and log data to a remote server, keeping the data updated over the internet. The data collected can be used to design pollution maps, personalised maps and route planning.


The main objectives of this project are:

To automate the manual control of the conventional street lights

To develop an IoT based real time air quality monitoring system

The system architecture of smart street lighting system with air quality monitoring.




Hardware requirements : Arduino UNO,LDR, IR sensors, Wi-Fi module (here ESP8266 Node MCU), MQ 135 sensor, MQ 3 module, LED lights and Jumper wires 

Software requirements : Arduino IDE, Thingspeak IoT platform





RESULTS

The automatic street light system worked successfully based on the principle of brightness and motion detection. The air quality monitoring system was tested in the presence of smoke and alcohol. When the level of pollutant exceeded the threshold limit, a warning was sent to the respective twitter account.
